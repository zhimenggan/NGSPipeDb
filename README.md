# NGSPipeDb

## Introduction

__NGSPipeDb__ is an automated pipeline for parallel processing of huge next generation sequencing (NGS) data and database generation using [snakemake workflow](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) which allows for ease of use, optimal speed, and a highly modular code that can be further added onto and customized by experienced users. It can be further divided into `NGSPipe` and `NGSDb` for individual usage.
