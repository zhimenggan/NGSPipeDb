<h3>Experiment1</h3>
<p>Eight organs, including roots (Ro), stems (St), shoot apexes (SA), mature leaves (ML), male flowers (MF), female
  flowers
  (FF), fruits (Fr), and seeds (Se), were harvested in August from the 1-year-old plants of Sacha Inchi grown at the
  Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Mengla, Yunnan, China under natural climate
  conditions. The samples were collected at 60 days after pollination (DAP) when fruits and seeds have reached full
  size. Three independent biological replicates of each sample were collected from three individual plants. All samples
  were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 Â°C for RNA extraction.</p>
